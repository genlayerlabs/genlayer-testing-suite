# Cut a release on the current owning version branch.
#
# Bumps pyproject.toml, updates CHANGELOG.md via python-semantic-release,
# commits, tags vX.Y.Z, and pushes both the branch commit and the tag.
# publish.yml takes over from the tag push (build → PyPI publish →
# GitHub Release).
#
# Releases are deliberate. There is no auto-bump on push; only this
# script is supposed to create release tags. Run from the release line
# that owns the version: vX.Y for finals and vX.Y-dev for RCs.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release.sh <X.Y.Z>          # final release from vX.Y
#   scripts/release.sh <X.Y.Z-rc.N>     # release candidate from vX.Y-dev
#   scripts/release.sh patch            # 0.29.0 → 0.29.1
#   scripts/release.sh minor            # 0.29.0 → 0.30.0 — needs --allow-major
#   scripts/release.sh major            # 0.29.0 → 1.0.0  — needs --allow-major
#   scripts/release.sh --allow-major <X.Y.Z>
#   scripts/release.sh --dry-run [--allow-major] <version>
#
# Semver-zero rule: while the major is 0, the MINOR is the breaking-
# change boundary. The script refuses minor/major changes without
# --allow-major.
#
# Pre-flight (each check refuses to proceed on failure):
#   - On vX.Y for a final or vX.Y-dev for a release candidate
#   - Working tree clean
#   - Local HEAD matches origin/<branch>
#   - Tests workflow on that exact HEAD is green
