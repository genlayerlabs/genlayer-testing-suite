#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Cut a release on the current stable branch.
#
# Bumps pyproject.toml, updates CHANGELOG.md via python-semantic-release,
# commits, tags vX.Y.Z, and pushes both the branch commit and the tag.
# publish.yml takes over from the tag push (build → PyPI publish →
# GitHub Release).
#
# Releases are deliberate. There is no auto-bump on push; only this
# script is supposed to create release tags. Run from the major branch
# you want to ship a release on (e.g. v0.29 for v0.29.x).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release.sh <X.Y.Z>     # explicit semver — recommended
#   scripts/release.sh patch       # 0.18.0 → 0.18.1
#   scripts/release.sh minor       # 0.18.0 → 0.19.0 — refused unless --allow-major (see below)
#   scripts/release.sh major       # 0.18.0 → 1.0.0  — refused unless --allow-major
#   scripts/release.sh --allow-major <X.Y.Z>
#
# Semver-zero rule: while the major is 0, the MINOR is the breaking-
# change boundary (per semver). 0.18 → 0.19 IS a major bump. The script
# refuses both `minor` and `major` keywords without --allow-major while
# the current major is 0. Patches stay automatic-friendly.
#
# Pre-flight (each check refuses to proceed on failure):
#   - On a v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>] branch (refuses on main / feature branches)
#   - Working tree clean
#   - Local HEAD matches origin/<branch>
#   - Latest CI run on HEAD is green
